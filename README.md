Also the manner how the husband with some of his neighbours did use this priest comming to tempt his wife in their owne house, first they whipt him about the chamber, and afterward gelded him, as a most just recompence for his lasciviousnesse. As also, how a witty maid served a romish Catholique about the like matter, making him to fall into a river, where he scarce escaped drowning.#
